            "Kartik is a joy to work with. He is hardworking and persistent, making sure to deliver the work assigned to him completely and on time. When there are things he doesn't know how to do yet, he is eager to learn and is fast on the pickup. Aside from his technical skills, he also has excellent soft skills and communications. He deals with issues and provides constructive feedback tactfully, all while maintaining a positive outlook. Kartik is an indispensable team player â€” having seen his work ethic and skills, any software team will be lucky to have Kartik on the team. ",

            "During a three-month fellowship, I had the opportunity to work with Kartik as his product manager. In the team, he took a lot of initiative and responsibility and thus decisively advanced the product. He also transferred his great motivation and persistence to the others, helping people with their issues, technical or design. He has the ability to explain complex technical topics in such a way that they can be understood even without SE background. It has been an honor to work with Kartik, and I wish him nothing but success on his future endavours.",
