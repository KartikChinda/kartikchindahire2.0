He deals with issues and provides constructive feedback tactfully, all while maintaining a positive outlook. Kartik is an indispensable team player and any software team will be lucky to have Kartik on the team. ",

            "I had the opportunity to work with Kartik as his product manager. In the team, he took a lot of initiative and responsibility and thus decisively advanced the product. He also transferred his great motivation and persistence to the others, helping people with their issues, technical or design. He has the ability to explain complex technical topics in such a way that they can be understood even without SE background. It has been an honor to work with Kartik, and I wish him nothing but success on his future endavours.",
